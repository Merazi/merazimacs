# vanilla-merazimacs

## what is this?

This is my configuration file for GNU Emacs, but with a twist:
I'm *not* allowed to use anything from Melpa, even tho *Melpa packages
are great*, I want to do this for *educational purposes only*.
I also wrote a small post about it explaining my motivation and goals:

If this is somehow useful to you I'll be more than happy!

## additional resources

While making this configuration I had to read a lot of blog posts, docs
and tutorials to achieve what I needed, I decided to put them here so
you can read them and learn as I did, it is worth the effort. :D
